# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-28)

**Core value:** A single scroll-driven choreography that introduces the product UI as a shared element morphing through the page — emerging from the hand-drawn paper world, scaling to a full reveal, then docking to the side as features explain themselves.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Orchestrator Shell + Backdrop Migration

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Six phases derived from research SUMMARY.md — Foundation → Orchestrator+Backdrop → Product Screen → Copy+Trust+Meta → Cutover → Audit/Ship.
- Roadmap: Static stacked fallback is the foundation (Phase 1), not an afterthought — choreography is the enhancement that overlays it.
- Roadmap: `paper-hero.tsx` migration is one atomic unit in Phase 2; old component is not deleted until Phase 5 cutover.
- Roadmap: Phase 3 and Phase 6 flagged for `/gsd-research-phase` (multi-stop `useTransform` stitching + LCP responsive-image; audit playbook + real-device iOS Safari).
- Phase 2 page-tail fix (2026-04-29): production-preview revealed that the route swap (D-01) dropped `<ProofStrip />` and `<FinalCta />` on desktop+motion. Root cause: research/ARCHITECTURE.md System Overview specified ProofStrip + FinalCta as siblings of `<ScrollChoreography>`, but Phase 1 D-01 nested them inside `<StaticChoreographyFallback>`. Plan 05 Task 1 swapped routes/index.tsx to `<ScrollChoreography>`, which only rendered the hero+wow choreography subtree. Static-mode users still saw all 5 sections via the early-return; choreography-mode users lost the page tail. Fixed by rendering `<ProofStrip />` + `<FinalCta />` as siblings of the choreography `<section>` inside `ChoreographyTree`'s return. Static branch unchanged. Phase 5's MIGRATE-05 may consider lifting them to routes/index.tsx proper as part of the StaticChoreographyFallback refactor.
- Phase 2 FOUND-04 / OQ-1 verdict (2026-04-29 via `pnpm build && pnpm preview` smoke): **Outcome C — inconclusive.** First test was confounded by (a) the page-tail regression masking the choreography reading, (b) a font FOUT on first load (pre-existing — separate from FOUND-04), and (c) `vite preview`'s built-in server lacking HTTP-range support, which delays MP4 metadata availability and makes the video appear "not loaded". The classic FOUND-04 mid-page hard-refresh flicker test was not isolated cleanly. The `layoutEffect: false` option remains in scroll-choreography.tsx as the Phase 1 contract. RESEARCH.md OQ-1's Option C path applies — Phase 5's Vercel production deploy verification (per ROADMAP SC #4 "no production-only useScroll-returns-0 flicker") is the next gate; Vercel's edge serves range requests properly, removing the video-load confound. Re-verify after the page-tail fix lands.
- Phase 2 D-14 STAGES.wow.window retune (2026-04-29 via `pnpm preview` visual review): **deferred re-verify.** First-pass `[0.20, 0.78]` could not be visually validated because the page-tail regression and video-scrub timing issue both masked the scrub feel. Value is preserved in stages.ts. Re-verify after the page-tail fix is in browser. Phase 3 may revisit when feature-a/b docking transforms land.
- Phase 2 known issues (2026-04-29, non-blocking): (1) Font FOUT on first load — `@fontsource-variable` packages load via CSS without preload hints; pre-existing in Phase 1, not introduced by Phase 2; defer to Phase 6 audit. (2) `vite preview`'s built-in server does not honor `Range:` headers, so `<video preload="auto">` must download the full 3.3MB MP4 before metadata is available. With the autoplay-loop scope shift this is largely moot for Phase 2 (loop kicks in once metadata loads), but document in Phase 6 audit playbook so future preview-build smokes account for it.
- Phase 2 CHOREO-02 / CHOREO-08 scope shift (2026-04-29 user direction during production-preview smoke): the hero video switches from scroll-linked `currentTime` scrubbing to a continuously-playing `autoPlay loop`. Same storytelling intent (background motion in the paper world during stage 1) with a simpler primitive and tempo decoupled from scroll speed. CHOREO-08's pause-when-covered GPU-relief intent is preserved — the gate now calls `video.pause()` above `byId('wow').window[1]` and `video.play()` below. REQUIREMENTS.md CHOREO-02 / CHOREO-08 literal text ("scroll-linked", "currentTime updates are gated") is now stale relative to shipped behavior; deferred-cleanup item. The shipped contract is: autoplay-loop + threshold-paused. PaperBackdrop's `loadedmetadata` effect + `videoDurationRef` were removed (duration no longer needed). paper-backdrop.test.tsx was updated to assert autoplay/loop attrs + play()/pause() calls + a regression-guard that `currentTime` is never written.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Real iOS Safari address-bar behavior is described in research but not verified on-device — closes via Phase 6 dedicated smoke test.
- Post-cutover LCP candidate is unknown until the larger product screenshot lands — closes via Phase 3 (responsive `srcset` + preload) confirmed at Phase 6 (Lighthouse vs baseline).
- Real teacher testimonials don't yet exist — soft "Built with teachers" trust line ships v1; testimonials are a v1.x follow-up.
